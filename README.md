My name is Matheus and i'm a creator! I'm brasilian and i absolutely love technology! For a long time I had a big ol' crush on her and when a opportunity to study it presented itself i just had to grab with nail an teeth. So far i completed a lot of small projects and a few great ones to improve my skills. Here's the stack that i have some or good knowledge:

- PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter)
- Javascript (Vue.js, Angular, React & NextJS)
- HTML
- CSS (SASS, Bootstrap, Materialize)
- Python
- SQL (MySQL, Sqlite & Oracle)
- C++ (Unity & Arduino)
- Bash (Shell Linux)
 
 In addition to those, i have a few Soft Skills that i would love to show, facing a good cup of coffee or tea. Mainly I'm good at problem solving and therefore, I always check the situation trying to find the quickest and the best solution. I'm a great communicator and a team player all the way, specially I love facing challenges and I have no trouble working under pressure or in a timeline.
 
 My goal with technology is continue to improve my skills as a developper and a person.
